# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection using YOLOv8

This project uses the YOLOv8 deep learning model to detect plant diseases in real-time from video or images.  
It was trained on a custom dataset of leaf images and can be applied in smart agriculture.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time detection of plant diseases
- Supports video and image inputs
- Easy to run with Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `train_and_detect.ipynb` â†’ Training + detection notebook
- `best.pt` â†’ Trained YOLOv8 weights (link if too large for GitHub)
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Python dependencies
- `output_detected.jpg` â†’ Example detection imgs

## ðŸ”§ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrageethDisanayaka/tea_leaves_disease_detection
cd tea_leaves_disease_detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
